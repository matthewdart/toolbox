# Governance Consistency & Drift Audit Report

Generated: 2026-01-27T22:29:16Z

## Executive Summary

- Audited as a system: `MANIFESTO.md`, `TECH_CONSTITUTION.md`, `REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PLAYBOOK.md` (cross-checked `README.md` + `audits/*` for references).
- Core doctrine is consistent: inspectability, canonical-vs-derived, headless operability, evidence/provenance, and “AI is not authority” reinforce each other.
- Primary authority ambiguity: Playbook claims it is the “single consolidated reference” (`PLAYBOOK.md:3`) while the Reference Architecture positions the docs as separate force layers (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:23-28`).
- Primary force-level ambiguity: the Reference Architecture says its defaults are “presumptive, not mandatory” (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:7`) yet contains multiple “MUST”/“MUST NOT” constraints under “Default/Hard Constraints” (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:293-329`, `REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:536-592`).
- Early drift signal: the Reference Architecture contains duplicated sections (Evidence/Provenance repeated; two “7.*” containerisation blocks) (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:246-357`, `REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:522-643`).
- The Playbook references audits and repo paths that are not present here (“Agent Capability & Exposure Audit”; `docs/*`; `capabilities/*.yaml`) (`PLAYBOOK.md:151-188`).
- No direct contradictions against constitutional invariants were found; other documents mostly strengthen or operationalise them.
- Overall assessment: **Coherent, moderate drift risk**.

## Confirmed Alignments

- Force hierarchy is explicitly stated and broadly respected:
  - Constitution scopes itself to “minimum validity conditions” and excludes preferences/defaults (`TECH_CONSTITUTION.md:5-8`, `TECH_CONSTITUTION.md:95-96`).
  - Reference Architecture claims to encode “strong defaults” and explicitly points validity/procedure/values elsewhere (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:7-16`).
- Manifesto and Playbook share the same optimisation target and core outcomes without internal contradiction:
  - “Insight per unit of effort, sustained over time.” (`MANIFESTO.md:9-12`, `PLAYBOOK.md:31-35`)
  - Same anti-goals list appears in both (`MANIFESTO.md:55-65`, `PLAYBOOK.md:89-103`).
- Constitutional invariants are reinforced (not undermined) by the other documents:
  - Invariant 1 (Inspectable Authority): file/git-first ecosystem defaults and “AI not system of record” constraints (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:34-79`, `REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:478-499`).
  - Invariant 2 + 5 (Explicit Causality/Boundaries): protocol-first interfaces and explicit service boundaries (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:84-127`); Playbook’s “capability semantics vs invocation mechanics” (`PLAYBOOK.md:61-70`).
  - Invariant 3 (Bounded State Ownership): UI treated as signal surface, not owner (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:201-219`, `PLAYBOOK.md:66-67`); canonical-vs-derived framing (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:133-174`, `PLAYBOOK.md:77-82`).
- Evidence-first posture is consistent:
  - “Agent actions produce inspectable evidence.” (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:246-260`)
  - “Audits are diagnostic, not prescriptive. Evidence precedes change.” (`PLAYBOOK.md:137-140`)
  - AI Slop Audit prompt explicitly requires evidence-based conclusions (`audits/AI_SLOP_AUDIT.md:15-18`, `audits/AI_SLOP_AUDIT.md:76-83`).

## Force-Level Violations (with quotes and references)

1) Authority layering ambiguity (Playbook vs the four-document system)

> “This document is the single consolidated reference for intent, principles, diagnostics, and operationalisation…” (`PLAYBOOK.md:3`)

Contrasts with:

> “Tech Constitution — defines minimum validity constraints … Reference Architecture — defines ecosystem defaults … Playbook — defines execution, audits, and agent behaviour” (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:23-28`)

Interpretation risk: “single consolidated reference” reads like a *superseding authority claim* rather than a procedural/operational document, which can cause agents/humans to ignore the Constitution/Reference Architecture layers.

2) Operational procedure leaking into the Manifesto (values → process)

> “All non-trivial refactors follow a two-phase flow: … Plan phase … Patch phase … Implement exactly the approved plan” (`MANIFESTO.md:189-205`)

This is procedural gating; per the intended force hierarchy, it reads more like Playbook operationalisation than manifesto-level selection pressure.

3) Defaults written as laws inside the Reference Architecture (force-level mismatch)

The Reference Architecture frames itself as “presumptive, not mandatory”:

> “These defaults are presumptive, not mandatory.” (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:7`)

But it repeatedly uses “MUST/MUST NOT” under “Default” or “Hard Constraints”, e.g.:

> “Services MUST NOT be exposed directly to the public internet by default” (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:293-294`)

> “Secrets MUST NOT be committed to repositories” (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:325-329`)

> “Canonical state MUST NOT live inside container filesystems” (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:534-538`)

This creates force-level ambiguity: the language signals constitutional validity constraints, while the document claims to define defaults/fit (and explicitly says it does not define validity) (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:15`).

4) Misclassification inventory for “MUST/SHOULD/REQUIRED” constraints in Reference Architecture + Playbook

Classification rule used: “Valid invariant” = seems like “system invalid if violated”; “Strong default” = ecosystem-fit preference; “Operational rule” = execution/workflow guidance; “Misclassified” = wrong force level signalled by language or placement.

- `REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:293` “Services MUST NOT be exposed directly to the public internet by default”
  - Classification: **Strong default (correctly placed) but force-language mismatch** (reads as constitutional).
- `REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:302` “Services that must be internet-facing SHOULD be exposed via a managed edge tunnel”
  - Classification: **Strong default**.
- `REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:328` “Secrets MUST NOT be committed to repositories”
  - Classification: **Misclassified (reads as validity constraint / hard prohibition despite “defaults” framing)**.
- `REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:329` “Secrets MUST NOT be required to understand system behaviour”
  - Classification: **Misclassified / ambiguous** (tightly coupled to Constitution’s inspectability idea, but expressed as a hard constraint in a defaults document).
- `REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:512` “Each project SHOULD include a short [conformance] statement…”
  - Classification: **Strong default**.
- `REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:536` “Canonical state MUST NOT live inside container filesystems”
  - Classification: **Valid invariant (container-specific expression of bounded authority)**, but currently encoded as a defaults constraint.
- `REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:559` “Portable deployments MUST preserve the network exposure model…”
  - Classification: **Strong default**, with force-language mismatch.
- `REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:590-592` “Containers MUST NOT become systems of record … Authoritative state MUST live outside … Behaviour MUST remain explainable…”
  - Classification: **Valid invariants** (derivable from Constitution’s authority/causality/boundary requirements), but currently encoded as defaults constraints.
- `REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:600` “Every significant tool or service SHOULD be runnable headlessly without containers.”
  - Classification: **Strong default**.
- `PLAYBOOK.md:106-112` (“must be explicit / must exist / must be observable… / must be visible / must be regenerable…”)
  - Classification: **Operational rules** (implementation principles) — consistent with Playbook force level.
- `PLAYBOOK.md:165-168` “Outcome must be one of…”
  - Classification: **Operational rule** (audit output constraint).

No clear cases were found where a constitutional “MUST” was explicitly weakened into a “nice-to-have” elsewhere; the main issue is the reverse (defaults written like laws).

## Drift & Ambiguity Risks

- Dual-source doctrine drift risk (Manifesto vs Playbook overlap):
  - Both encode the same optimisation target and anti-goals (`MANIFESTO.md:5-22`, `PLAYBOOK.md:22-35`, `MANIFESTO.md:55-65`, `PLAYBOOK.md:89-103`).
  - Refactoring/tool-admission doctrine exists in both, with different depth and wording (`MANIFESTO.md:93-117`, `PLAYBOOK.md:118-133`, `MANIFESTO.md:152-233`).
  - Risk: future edits can cause silent divergence between two “authoritative” texts.
- Internal duplication inside Reference Architecture (self-drift evidence):
  - “### 5.2 Evidence and Provenance” appears twice with identical text (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:246-260` and `REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:342-357`).
  - Two containerisation trajectories exist (“## 7A…” and later “## 7. Portability & Containerisation…”) with overlapping constraints (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:522-569` and `REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:572-643`).
- Tool-identity creep in defaults:
  - Reference Architecture names specific vendors/tools as “Default Tools” (Tailscale/Cloudflare/Apple Shortcuts/Obsidian/reMarkable/GitHub/OpenAI) (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:364-499`).
  - Mitigation exists (“Exit Path”), but the density of named tools increases the chance of outdated assumptions being treated as doctrine.
- Playbook references non-existent-in-this-repo artefacts (unclear if illustrative vs required):
  - `docs/manifesto/CONSOLIDATED.md`, `docs/policies/POLICIES.md`, `capabilities/*.yaml`, `docs/audit-runs/YYYY-MM-DD/` (`PLAYBOOK.md:176-188`).
  - “9.2 Agent Capability & Exposure Audit” is described but no corresponding audit prompt exists in `audits/` (`PLAYBOOK.md:151-160`).
- Time-stamping embedded in doctrine:
  - “Pragmatic Implementation Principles (2026-Viable)” (`PLAYBOOK.md:104-112`) is an explicit clock signal; without update discipline it can rot into “frozen assumptions”.

## Agent Interpretation Risks

- “Playbook as sole authority” risk:
  - An agent can reasonably stop at “single consolidated reference” and miss the constitutional invalidity tests (`PLAYBOOK.md:3` vs `TECH_CONSTITUTION.md:13-14`).
- “Defaults treated as laws” risk in Reference Architecture:
  - The combination of “presumptive, not mandatory” with “MUST/MUST NOT” can cause an agent to enforce ecosystem-fit defaults as invalidity constraints, blocking legitimate divergence (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:7` vs `REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:293-329`).
- Procedural overreach risk from Manifesto:
  - The “approved plan” gating language can be read as required governance process even when the playbook/constitution are silent about such approvals (`MANIFESTO.md:191-205`).
- Repo-shape fabrication risk:
  - An agent may attempt to create the `docs/*` and `capabilities/*` structures referenced in the Playbook to “make the system consistent”, increasing surface area without pressure (`PLAYBOOK.md:176-188`).
- Ecosystem-specific audit overapplication:
  - The presence of an Archi-specific maintainer acceptance audit can be mistaken as generally applicable acceptance criteria for unrelated ecosystems (`PLAYBOOK.md:161-168`, `audits/ARCHI_MAINTAINER_ACCEPTANCE_AUDIT.md:8-24`).

## Gaps & Explicitly Acknowledged Unknowns

- Secrets management is explicitly “under-specified” while still listing “Hard Constraints” (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:321-338`). The boundary between “gap” vs “invariant” is unclear in-force.
- Network threat model is referenced but not specified:
  - “Direct public exposure requires explicit justification and threat consideration” (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:313-316`), but no shared threat model or exception template exists in-repo.
- Conformance declaration lifecycle is not described:
  - RA asks projects to include a conformance declaration (`REFERENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md:510-518`), but the Playbook does not define how agents produce/verify it, nor where it lives.
- Missing audit artefact:
  - “Agent Capability & Exposure Audit” is described but not present as a concrete prompt in `audits/` (`PLAYBOOK.md:151-160`, `git ls-files` shows only `audits/AI_SLOP_AUDIT.md` and `audits/ARCHI_MAINTAINER_ACCEPTANCE_AUDIT.md`).
- Exception recording mechanism is defined at constitution level but not operationalised:
  - Constitution requires documented exceptions with exit/review conditions (`TECH_CONSTITUTION.md:79-87`); no canonical location/template for exceptions is defined in these docs.

## Overall Assessment

Coherent, moderate drift risk
