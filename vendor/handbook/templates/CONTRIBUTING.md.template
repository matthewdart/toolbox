# Contributing

## Source of truth

Before implementing any change, read:
<!-- REPO-SPECIFIC: List authoritative docs. Examples:
- docs/CONTRACT.md
- docs/requirements/index.md
- docs/acceptance/index.md
- docs/architecture/index.md
- docs/adrs/*
-->

## Environment setup

<!-- REPO-SPECIFIC: How to set up a development environment. Examples:
- `npm install` / `pip install -e .` / etc.
- Required tools and versions
- Environment variables or config files
-->

## Testing

<!-- REPO-SPECIFIC: How to run tests. Examples:
- `npm run test` — unit tests
- `npm run test:integration` — integration tests (requires API keys)
-->

## Ticket and PR discipline

<!-- REPO-SPECIFIC: Rules for issues and PRs. Adapt to your needs:
- Reference requirement IDs or issue numbers
- Include tests where practical
- Close issues only after relevant changes are committed
-->

## Safety

- Never commit .env files or secrets
- Prefer user-level installs over sudo

<!-- REPO-SPECIFIC: Add project-specific safety rules. Examples:
- Read-only device access only (no device mutation)
- LLM boundaries (e.g. LLMs for OCR only, not for deterministic transforms)
-->
