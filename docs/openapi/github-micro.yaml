        > [!NOTE]

        > GitHub''s REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every
        issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both
        issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by
        the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned
        from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull request
        id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)"
        endpoint.


        This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information,
        see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."


        - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response
        will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media
        type.

        - **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only representation
        of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.

        - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the body''s
        markdown. Response will include `body_html`.

        - **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations.

        access, the API returns a `410 Gone` status. To receive webhook events for
        transferred and deleted issues, subscribe

        to the [`issues`](https://docs.github.com/webhooks/event-payloads/#issues)
        webhook.


        > [!NOTE]

        > GitHub''s REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every
        issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both
        issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by
        the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned
        from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull request
        id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)"
        endpoint.


        This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information,
        see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."


        - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response
        will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media
        type.

        - **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only representation
        of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.

        - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the body''s
        markdown. Response will include `body_html`.

        - **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations.
        Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and `body_html`.'

        \ of the API, the type will be returned as \"submodule\".\n\nIf the content\
        \ is a symlink and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository,\
        \ then the API responds with the content of the file. Otherwise, the API responds\
        \ with an object describing the symlink itself.\n\nIf the content is a submodule,\
        \ the `submodule_git_url` field identifies the location of the submodule repository,\
        \ and the `sha` identifies a specific commit within the submodule repository.\
        \ Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks\
        \ out the submodule at that specific commit. If the submodule repository is\
        \ not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links[\"git\"]`)\
        \ and the github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links[\"html\"]`) will have null\
        \ values.\n\n**Notes**:\n\n- To get a repository's contents recursively, you\
        \ can [recursively get the tree](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).\n\
        - This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need\
        \ to retrieve\nmore files, use the [Git Trees API](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).\n\
        - Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the download\
        \ URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a fresh download\
        \ URL for each download.\n- If the requested file's size is:\n  - 1 MB or\
        \ smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.\n  - Between 1-100\
        \ MB: Only the `raw` or `object` custom media types are supported. Both will\
        \ work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content`\
        \ field will be an empty\nstring and the `encoding` field will be `\"none\"\
        `. To get the contents of these larger files, use the `raw` media type.\n\
        \  - Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported."
